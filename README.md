# OHL project week

# How to start this pygame:

- First you go into the operation speedboat folder
- After that, you install all the needed requirements. You can do this like this: pip install -r requirements.txt
- To run the pygame, you need to do : .\venv\Scripts\python.exe .\main.py


# What can you do on the pygame?

- You can see a whole game from above
- You can see see 2 graphs from that certain game

# Where is everything located?

- Everything we used is in the operation speedboat folder
- Our queries are located in Python/helperfunctions.py
- All the graphs we used are in the graphs.py file, to make a matplot graph, and then you give it to this function matplotlib_to_pygame_surface(fig) . This returns a pygame surface.
- In game.py you can find everything on how the pygame works
- Initializing for all the matches is in the main.py
